# googlecalendar: Google Calendar for R

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benjcunningham/googlecalendar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benjcunningham/googlecalendar)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/benjcunningham/googlecalendar/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/benjcunningham/googlecalendar?branch=master)

**googlecalendar** makes Google Calendar easily accessible through R.
The package offers a collection of functions for accessing and modifying
calendars, events, and UI settings via Google's
[Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/).
While not a verbatim port of available methods, the package aims to
provide intuitive commands for interacting with the Calendar service.

This project is inspired in part by
[googlesheets](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets), a Google Sheets
interface for R. googlesheets is a wonderful project, and this package
attempts to mirror its ease of use. Most notably, googlecalendar has
been designed with a similar ambition for compatability with the
[magrittr](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) `%>%` pipe operator.

Under the hood, googlecalendar uses the
[httr](https://github.com/hadley/httr) and
[jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroenooms/jsonlite) packages for
administering HTTP requests and coercing responses.

## Development Note

This project is still very much in an early development stage. Not only
is ~~a great deal of~~ most functionaly still missing, but virtually no
tests have been formalized. All the same, feel free to share any initial
feedback on the project via the
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/benjcunningham/googlecalendar/issues)
page while we work to stabilize the package API and round out its basic functionality.

## Installation & Setup

To install the current development version:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("benjcunningham/googlecalendar")
```

To use googlecalendar, you will need access to a Google Calendar API
client key and secret. To obtain these, visit the
[Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and
register a new application. Once you have generated a key and secret,
you can set them for persistent use in an `.Rprofile` file:

```{r eval = FALSE}
options(
  googlecalendar.client_key = "<KEY>",
  googlecalendar.client_secret = "<SECRET>"
)
```

Every function in this package that sends a request to the Google
Calendar API must also include an authorization token. Fortunately, in
almost all cases, the OAuth 2.0 process is evoked internally. However,
you can use the following method to manually initialize the process:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(googlecalendar)
gc_auth(new_user = TRUE)
```

From here, you will be automatically redirected to your web browser
and asked to sign-in and grant permission for googlecalendar to access
the Google Calendar API on your behalf. A similar mechanism will trigger
when a network function is called without previously authorizing the
application. When an access token becomes stale, the next function to
make a request to the Calendar service will automatically handle
fetching a new one without reinitializing the full authentication
procedure (i.e. browser-based logins should happen only once per
session). Note that googlecalendar currently only handles
credentialling of one user at a time.

To deauthorize the current user and permanently remove their cached
credentials:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gc_deauth(clear_cache = TRUE)
```

## Usage

_If you haven't already, make sure to read the section above on the
basics of setting up the package. Recall that to get started you ought
to have stored your newly-registered Google application client
credentials in your `.Rprofile`._

Let's just jump right in and create a new calendar for demonstrating
some core functionality. No need to worry about authenticating ahead of
time &mdash; `gc_new()` will take care of redirecting you to a browser
if necessary.

```{r}
library(googlecalendar)
cal <- gc_new("useR Meetups", location = "University of Iowa")
```

And here is what that new calendar looks like, saved as a
`googlecalendar` object:

```{r echo = FALSE}
print(cal)
```

Don't worry if that doesn't look like much. The `print()` dispatch for
this object class intentionally hides a lot of non-essential
information. To see what lies beneath the surface, we can use
`str(cal)`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
str(cal)
```

While not perfect, googlecalendar attempts to faithfully represent
objects according to the structure of their originating Google Calendar
API resource. Generally, properties are named and typed identically to
how they are returned by the service.

Taking a closer look at `cal`, it looks like we forgot to pass along a
few useful properties in our original creation method. We can add these
now using:

```{r}
cal <- gc_edit(
  cal,
  description = "Iowa City's useR Group",
  timeZone = "America/Chicago",
  colorId = "20"
)
```

For good measure, let's convince ourselves that the changes were made
and returned:

```{r echo = FALSE}
str(cal)
```

Like all functions in the package, `gc_edit()` attempts to return a
useful object (in this case the updated calendar) that can be piped into
another function. Accordingly, we overwrite `cal` so that we keep the
current version of the calendar in our environment. We'll cover more
on chaining package functions later.

Finally, we can go ahead and delete our demonstration calendar:

```{r}
gc_delete(cal)
```

_More to come soon (and eventually be dumped in a vignette)..._

## Functions Overview

```{r as.is = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
ftbl <- read.csv("functions.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
knitr::kable(ftbl)
```
