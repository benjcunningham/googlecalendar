\description{
Easily access and modify calendars, events, and UI settings via the
Google Calendar API.
}
\details{
\code{googlecalendar} makes Google Calendar easily accessible through
R. The package offers a collection of functions for accessing and
modifying calendars, events, and UI settings via Google's
\href{https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/}{Calendar API}.
Rather than porting the available methods verbatim, the package aims
to provide intuitive commands for interacting with Calendar services.

For more information on installation, usage, and project development,
see the official
\href{https://github.com/benjcunningham/googlecalendar}{README} on
GitHub.
